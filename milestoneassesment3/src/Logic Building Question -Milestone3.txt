Task preview - J2EE- UserProfile CRUD


Developing a User Profile Management Service


Introduction
In a J2EE application, managing user profiles effectively is fundamental for maintaining
application functionality and user interaction. This involves creating, retrieving, updating,
and deleting user profiles using in-memory data structures like Java Map collections. The
service should ensure efficient data handling and provide basic CRUD operations while
maintaining application scalability and reliability.


Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a user profile management service for a simple J2EE
application using Java Map for storage. The service will handle CRUD operations for user
profiles, maintaining data integrity within the application runtime environment.


createUserProfile(String userId, UserProfile userProfile): This method creates a
new user profile with the provided user ID and profile details. If a user with the same
ID already exists in the Java Map, it should return false. Otherwise, it should store
the profile details in the Java Map and return true upon successful creation.

getUserProfile(String userId): This method retrieves the user profile for the given
user ID from the Java Map. If the user ID does not exist, it should return null.
Otherwise, it should return a UserProfile object containing the user's details.

updateUserProfile(String userId, UserProfile updatedProfile): This method
updates an existing user profile with the provided updatedProfile in the Java Map. It
should replace the existing profile details with the new ones and return true upon
successful update. If the user ID does not exist, it should return false.

deleteUserProfile(String userId): This method deletes the user profile associated
with the given user ID from the Java Map. It should return true if the profile was
successfully deleted. If the user ID does not exist, it should return false.
